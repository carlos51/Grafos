# Puzzle Game Prototype – Graph-Based Mechanics

This repository contains an **unfinished Unity puzzle game prototype** developed collaboratively with a small team.

The core idea of the game is inspired by **graph theory**:
- Pins act as **nodes**
- Threads act as **edges**
- The objective is to cut and connect threads to form **cycles or Hamiltonian paths**

Gameplay is driven by physical interaction with threads, creating puzzles that combine spatial reasoning with graph-based constraints.

## My Contribution

My main responsibility in the project was the **integration and configuration of rope physics** for gameplay purposes.

- Integrated a third-party rope physics asset
- Adapted the asset to support gameplay interactions (cutting, reconnecting)
- Tuned physical parameters for stability and playability
- Worked closely with the game design to ensure puzzles behaved consistently

While the rope simulation itself was asset-based, the challenge involved **system integration, parameter tuning, and gameplay consistency**, rather than raw physics implementation.

## Team Contributions

- **UI / UX:** Interface design and user interaction
- **Monetization:** Advertisement system integration
- **Gameplay & Systems:** Collaborative design and iteration

## Project Status

The project was not completed due to time constraints, but it served as a valuable learning experience in:
- Team-based Unity development
- Integrating third-party systems into gameplay
- Designing mechanics based on mathematical structures
- Coordinating technical and design tasks

This repository is preserved as a prototype and learning artifact.
